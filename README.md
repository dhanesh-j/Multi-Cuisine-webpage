# Multi-Cuisine Food Website

## Project Overview

This project is a **multi-page web application** designed to showcase a variety of cuisines including Biryani, Chinese, Indian, and Italian dishes. Developed as a college mini project, it demonstrates fundamental front-end web development skills using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The application provides a simple yet interactive user experience, allowing users to browse different cuisine categories, view menu items, and simulate user login functionality.

## Detailed Functionality

### Homepage (`index.html`)
- Acts as the landing page with links to each cuisine category.
- Provides an overview and easy access to different sections of the website.

### Cuisine Pages (`Biryani.html`, `Chinese.html`, `Indian.html`, `Italian.html`)
- Display lists of popular dishes related to the specific cuisine.
- Each page is styled to reflect the cuisine's theme and aesthetics.
- May include images, descriptions, and "Add to Cart" buttons (if implemented).

### Login Page (`login.html`)
- Contains a simple login form with fields for username and password.
- Uses `loginscript.js` to validate input fields on the client side.
- No backend authentication; purely for demonstration purposes.

### JavaScript (`loginscript.js`)
- Validates login form inputs to ensure fields are not empty.
- Provides user feedback on incorrect or missing input.
- Can be extended to manage cart functionality or other dynamic behaviors.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
     git clone https://github.com/dhanesh-j/Multi-Cuisine-webpage.git


2. **Open the project folder** in your preferred code editor.

3. **Launch the website:**
- Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- Navigate through the cuisine pages using links.
- Use the login page to test form validation.

---

## Challenges Faced

- Ensuring consistent styling across multiple pages while maintaining unique themes for each cuisine.
- Implementing JavaScript validation without backend support.
- Managing navigation and user experience in a multi-page static website.
- Keeping the project simple yet functional within the constraints of a college mini project.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Backend Integration:** Connect to a server-side backend (e.g., Node.js, PHP) for real user authentication and data storage.
- **Shopping Cart:** Implement a fully functional cart system with add/remove items and checkout.
- **Database:** Store menu items, user data, and orders in a database for dynamic content management.
- **Responsive Design:** Enhance mobile responsiveness using CSS media queries or frameworks like Bootstrap.
- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Add animations, transitions, and richer interactivity.
- **Accessibility:** Improve accessibility features to support users with disabilities.
